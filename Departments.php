                    <h3>Anesthiology</h3>
                    <p class="fst-italic">The Anesthesiology department at the LAU Gilbert and Rose-Marie Chagoury School of Medicine and the Lebanese American University Medical Center-Rizk Hospital (LAU Medical Center-Rizk Hospital) is one of the leading anestheisology departments, in the country. With its rich faculty makeup, be it levels of experience and training, the strict focus on quality of care on top of all other considerations, the dedication to teaching on all fronts and the structured program for continuous professional development, it has placed itself at the forefront of perioperative medicine as a whole.</p>
                    <p>Monitored Anesthesia Care means that an anesthesia provider will be with you throughout your procedures to provide you with sedative and pain medication. The amount of medication will be carefully measured, and depending on your needs, will result in anywhere from moderate to deep sedation. The end result is that your procedure can be performed without any anxiety or discomfort. During moderate sedation, you will usually be able to speak and respond to verbal cues throughout the procedure, communicating any discomfort you might experience to your anesthesia provider. During deep sedation, you will be completely unaware of your surroundings. Regardless of the depth of sedation required, your anesthesiologist will monitor your heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, and level of alertness closely throughout and after the procedure.</p>

                    <p class="fst-italic">The Ophthalmology department at the LAU Gilbert and Rose-Marie Chagoury School of Medicine and the Lebanese American University Medical Center-Rizk Hospital (LAU Medical Center-Rizk Hospital) has a rich history. It was one of the leading eye departments, if not the leading eye department, in the country including leading figures in ophthalmology among its physician members. Over the past years it has experienced some challenges and more recently, under the leadership of the new Dean of the School of Medicine and the new hospital administration, a plan for it to resume its historic leadership value, and even improve on it, has been put forth.</p>
                    <h4>Residency</h4>
                    <p>The Ophthalmology residency is a three-year clinical training program. The residency program director is Dr. Ama Sadaka. We offer 1 residency position yearly for a total of 3 residents in the program at any one time. These positions are open to graduates of accredited medical schools who have completed at least one year of postgraduate medical training. The residency training takes place at LAU Medical Center-Rizk Hospital mainly, where residents rotate in different subspecialties and run their own outpatient continuity clinics. In addition, they cover the emergency room, operating room and inpatient service at LAU Medical Center-Rizk Hospital. They also rotate at Clemenceau Medical Center and at Howard Karagheusian Commemorative Corporation.</p>
